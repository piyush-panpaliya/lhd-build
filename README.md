# lhd-build

Hey guys this is piyush panpaliya,This repo contains all the challenges that I have been doing in the mlh LHD Build event

## All the projects that I made:

- Twitter-bot
- Sudoku-solver
- Bill-splitter
- Cyper
- img-pixelart
- password-encrypter
- Rock-paper-scissor
- String-reverse

## What was my vision 
I focused on using terminal interfase ie cli because I prioritized the core logic in each challenges rather than how good it look.

## What I used
I used python in all the challenges since its the fastest way I could have completed the challenges and since I havent practiced it in a long time I thought it would be great to brush my skills in python.

## How to use this projects
All the projects are made using python and thus you will be requiring to have pthon installed

Install the required packages if there are any
```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install -r req.txt
```

now cd into the project you wanna use and write the following comman to run the script
```console
foo@bar:~$ python main.py
```
## Problems I faced
the main problem was the limited time had and completing most of the challenges was very hard for me.
